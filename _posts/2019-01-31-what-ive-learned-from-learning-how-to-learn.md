Learning new skills and keeping your existing skill set up-to-date is a challenge we all face in our professional lives. Every day a new technology or a new *buzzword* arises and it is challenging to catch the stream day by day. This can lead to frustration or at worst to paralysis, a refusal to learn or to conceive new ideas altogether; [Javascript Fatigue](http://www.allenpike.com/2015/javascript-framework-fatigue/) is a good example:

> "... the latest and greatest JavaScript framework comes around every sixteen minutes."

# Introduction
TODO


As a software engineer, my ability to learn new technologies and skills is vital for my day to day work and career in general. My first solution to this problem was **learning the theory behind** certain technologies, not the technology itself. This approach directed me to the basics of software development: paradigms and models (which I wrote about them on my Turkish blog)

Second solution: **Writing something about** a topic I wanted to learn. Writing about topic forces you think about every aspect of the topic, it makes you disciplined for following the sub-topics and naturally deepens your knowledge as well structures the existing knowledge making previously implicitly known facts more explicit.

These two approaches together did a great job in the beginning when I had the enthusiasm and lots of free time (I had broken my leg and stayed at home about four months). Soon enough, however, vast amounts of new topics started to accumulate again. I soon realized that the more I learnt the more new things I wanted to learn.

I wanted to learn quickly (and easily). Helpfully, I found this four week course on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn) to help me become a better, more effective learner. I attended Learning How To Learn; this post is about what I learned (pun intended) on that course.

## What Is Learning

![](/images/2019_01_31/krang.png)

In general, learning is what we do to increase or enhance our knowledge and gain expertise in a subject matter. Learning happens by gradually building up the number of bits of information and the connections between them. The "_bits of information_" are called chunks, building the connections is called chunking.


### Chunking

!!! CHUNK IMAGE
![](/images/2019_01_31/chunking.jpeg)

Chunks have a physical representation in our brain, they are neurons bound together (literally) through use and meaning. Chunking is the process of creating connections between the neurons. It happens when you are in a **focused mode** of learning or thinking. More about focused mode later.

The purpose of chunking is to gradually build towards understanding a _bigger picture_. Similar to how individual pieces of a puzzle don't carry a lot of meaning, but having lots of pieces connected together, one can start to see the overall picture forming.

Once you have enough chunks, you'll understand the **bigger picture** better. Interestingly, knowing the bigger picture beforehand can also speed up learning as the overall framework for the chunks already exists. It is much easier to see what kind of a piece is needed for a particular empty slot in an almost finished puzzle than it is to start the puzzle. Chunking is a bottom up process, where as getting the big picture is a top down process. If we can do both at the same time, we will develop a better understanding faster.

To achieve gaining lots of chunks, one must practice intently and regularly by using the focus mode. **Recalling** and testing yourself with what you've learned is the best method for grasping and strengthening knowledge into long term memory.

### Seeing the Bigger Picture

!!!PUZZLE IMAGE
![](/images/2019_01_31/bigpicture.png)

If you have lots of chunks on a topic, it is easier to get the bigger picture. Gaining as many chunks as possible while thinking about its place on the big picture helps learning a lot. Also, chunks can be knit together and create bigger chunks that once triggered you can accomplish a complex activity without using working memory.

The big picture is the meaning we are looking for. It can be specific to a field and it is often personal. It can be tricky as well, because you may not have enough knowledge or experience to grasp the bigger picture. This is what I call the pitfalls of the bigger picture. To mitigate this problem, one can try to be conscious about his/her missing parts in the picture. Obviously there would always be many missing parts because you can't know everything.

Chunks are not only connected within one specific field but also across fields - if you will, the chunks form not only one 2-dimensional puzzle but multiple interconnected hyper-dimensional puzzles. Often, you'll find that a chunk is related to multiple other chunks in multiple other fields, Oakley and Sejnowski call this **transfering**.

We've all experienced this, it's the sudden "_a-ha_" moment you experience when "_something clicks_" and you're understanding of a particular topic changes and becomes more general. The realisation that things you previously thought were disconnected are in fact connected; the world is suddenly that little bit more understandable and coherent. This, in essence, is what learning is all about.


## You're standing in your own way

It's quite common that you get stuck on a problem because you initially have some ideas about what the solution could be. These initial ideas may block your ability to see a better solution. This problem is known as **Einstellung**: you're limiting the possible range of solutions to some subset, which may not contain the best solution or indeed any solution. Einstellung can be challenging to overcome, especially when you have a new idea that you need to convince other people of. New ideas are easily rejected, without trying to understand what they actually are because they present a different approach than what people are already comfortable with.

This is very problematic, because difficult problems often require changing how you view the problem not just tweak the current appoach. **Interleaving** is practicing by different concepts, approaches and techniques all in one session. This can help you to be flexible and master the material, you are not stuck into a specific view or angle. Brain storms and **collaborative thinking** is a practical method of interleaving by scaling people and therefore increasing the number of viewpoints.

### Working Memory and Long Term Memory

Now that we've looked at what learning is and why one needs to practice it, let's look more closely how the brain works and more specifically how memory works. This is a nerdy blog so I will jump to computer terms and analogies:

!!!YODA IMAGE
![](/images/2019_01_31/yoda.jpg)

> **Working memory** is like the RAM of your laptop. RAM is the memory of the computer that CPU directly works on. If CPU needs another data apart from the RAM data, first it needs to read from a hard disk or somewhere else and load it to the RAM.

> **Long term memory** is like the hard disk of your computer. It is much bigger than your RAM, but it is slow and needs to be transferred to the RAM to be processed by CPU.

Apart from the analogy, we can say that working memory is a fast but limited power of the brain. So we need to use it efficiently (e.g. not letting something to distract you from your focused mode like turning off your phone notifications while working). And if we need to remember and learn the topic permanently, we need to transfer the information to our long term memory.

### Focused versus Diffuse Thinking

TODO: either write about Dali's experiments of the diffuse mode or remove the pic
![](http://uploads5.wikiart.org/images/salvador-dali.jpg!Portrait.jpg)

Our brains have two main *modes* of thinking; focused and diffused. **Focused mode** is the one when you are concentrated on a topic and you gain knowledge. But there is a drawback here; you sometimes can't see the different solutions or aspects when you're in focused mode.

> **Analogy:** When you are looking through a microscope, you can see the germs very clear and detailed, but probably you won't see your near surroundings (for example rats in the room!).

**Diffused mode** on the other hand, is a more relaxed mode of thinking, which can access broader parts of your brain and memory. Connections between different knowledges of your previous learnings (called **chunks** in the course) happen in this mode.

This mode is activated when you're sleeping, doing activities, shower, cleaning etc.

> To be able to learn efficiently, we have to use our brains by switching between these two modes sequentially. There is even a technique called the **Pomodoro technique** for this.

### Procrastination, Memory, and Sleep

Procrastination is the delaying activity when you encounter with a difficult task like doing your homework or project, and then you choose to look at facebook or twitter instead ðŸ˜ˆ. This is a very bad habit that if you are constantly doing this, you will absolutely fail in the end although you fool yourself with cat videos ðŸ˜¼. (some people try to do 2 things in parallel and procrastinate from one to another and wise versa, but I'm not sure whether it works)

!!!POMODORO IMAGE
![](/images/2019_01_31/pomodoro.png) The **Pomodoro technique** also helps you to solve the procrastination problem, by simply focusing on the process but _NOT_ the product of the process.

Our long term memory thrives with repetition and practice. Doing all the learning in a day won't help the long term memory a lot. Instead, we should consistently learn bit by bit in a long period.

> **Analogy:** Brain muscles are like our regular muscles. We need time, sleep and lots of practice to develop muscles.

TODO: PUT THIS TO SOMEWHERE ELSE??

Beside these techniques here my thoughts about preventing procrastination:

* First of all try to look at the bigger picture
* Write about it on your own words
* Prepare a list of sub-topics and related topics
* Recursively look at those topics
* Find ways to use what you learned.
* Repeat this cycle with the **spaced repetition**

# Techniques mentioned in this article

## Pomodoro Technique

I copied the description of Pomodoro Technique from wikipedia:

> The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. The technique uses a timer to break down work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks.

Basically using this technique, you can focus on the process itself rather than its results. It is a good way for dealing with procrastination.

## Spaced Repetition

Very nicely done interactive tutorial about spaced repetition and specifically the **leitner system**. I recommend you to create one hour free time for the tutorial and you will understand the science behind the spaced repetition, and some nice tools to use it.

**Note:** If you are serious about using the leitner system, I have found this from amazon: https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B06WGYRDNJ/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o03_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1

## Memory Palace

Some interesting technique that I haven't tried yet.

# Summarize

Learning new ideas is the essence of my career, maybe the living itself. Before learning a new idea, we should think about the learning itself. Knowing the good techniques and keeping away the bad habits can increase efficiency, and I believe this must be the principal skill to be developed. I regret I didn't find the course even before, but I'm happy that I got it and I believe it helped me already.
