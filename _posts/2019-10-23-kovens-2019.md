KOVENS is a yearly held conference which gathers together the computer scientists
and computational linguists community working with the German language.

This year's edition of KOVENS was held in the city of Erlangen, Germany,
consisting of a workshop sessions related with a data challenge.



The conference hold a data-challenge consisting of shared tasks, much inspired in
the vein of [SemEval](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/SemEval) but naturally focused
on the German language. This year there were two tasks:

- [Shared Task on Hierarchical Classification of Blurbs](https://competitions.codalab.org
- [Shared Task on the Identification of Offensive Language](https://projects.fzai.h-da.de/iggsa/)
/competitions/20139)


<!-- Data Challenge and Participation -->

The Comtravo data science team participated on the Hierarchical Classification
task. The challenge consisted on a hierarchical-document classification task where
the hierarchical structure of each document needs to be captured.

We explored two different strategies

Our systems achieved the 13th place out of 19 submissions for Sub-Task A and the
11th place out of 19 submissions for Sub-Task B.
